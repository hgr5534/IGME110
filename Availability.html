                Fortnite was originally released to the public on Windows, Mac, Xbox One, and PlayStation 4 on July 25, 2017, but the battle royale mode that the game is known for was not released until September 26 of the same year (Epic Games). The platforms the game was released on is the standard for most games, but on March 12, 2018, only six months after the release of the battle royale mode, Fortnite developers Epic Games launched the already popular game mode on iOS, and on August 9 of the same year, for Android devices as well--something that was unprecedented for any game (Epic Games). No other game before Fortnite had launched a mobile counterpart that played exactly the same as its console version. This was a large turning point for the game’s playerbase, as people who did not own a console or PC could now play and experience Fortnite. The final platform the game was released on is the Nintendo Switch on June 12, 2018 (Epic Games); being that the Switch is a gaming console that can also be handheld, Fortnite’s release on the platform bridged the gap between all of its console and PC players and its mobile players, further increasing the count of its playerbase. However, the great qualities of Fortnite’s accessibility do not end there. Not only is the game is completely free to play, but cross-play is available between all seven of its platforms--this means that players are allowed to play alongside people on the other platforms (Tach). Cross-play is a feature that is very scarce in the gaming industry, and to implement it on such a vast scale is completely unprecedented. Fortnite being free to play and allowing its players to “squad up” with their friends across the game’s seven platforms is what has helped it raise the number of its playerbase so high. Whenever someone unfamiliar with Fortnite hears about the game, it is extremely easy for them to download the game and play it; however, due to how much the game has referenced other media, both digital and real-world, it is unlikely that they do not know what the game is.
