            <h2>Crossover Events</h2>
            <p>
                Fortnite is unique among other video games in that it often crosses over with other popular media, both inside and outside of the game itself. Inside the game, however, Fortnite has featured several in-game items and events that reference other games, movies, and television shows. The first of these was in April 2018 to promote the highly successful blockbuster Avengers: Infinity War. This event featured a limited-time game mode that gave players the chance to play as Thanos, the central antagonist of the movie; a follow-up to this event was released in April 2019 to promote the movie’s second part, Avengers: Endgame, and allowed players to once again play as Thanos, as well as letting them use Iron Man’s hand repulsors, Captain America’s shield, Thor’s axe Stormbreaker, and Hawkeye’s bow and arrows (Thier); the game also made an appearance in the movie as well. It’s worthy to mention that Fortnite’s second crossover with Marvel Studios also added two sets of cosmetic items that players could purchase, respectively based on the characters Star-Lord and Black Widow that were featured in both of the movies. The other promotional crossover event Fortnite had for a movie was with Warner Bros.’s John Wick : Chapter 3 -- Parabellum. This event added another two sets of purchasable cosmetic items, this time based on the titular character of the movie, John Wick, and a supporting character, Sofia (Garst). Fortnite has also crossed other with the popular Netflix show Stranger Things (Gonzalez) and developer Gearbox’s video game Borderlands 3 (Kain), with each of these events adding more purchasable cosmetic items for players, as well as in-game locations for them to explore. Most recently, however, DC’s Batman and Catwoman made an appearance as buyable cosmetics as well, celebrating the 80th anniversary of Batman himself (Good). The addition of these two characters in Fortnite marks an accomplishment that many people thought would never happen: the inclusion of Marvel and DC in the same video game. For years, fans of the comic book giants have wanted them to collaborate on a project together, and it is only fitting for Fortnite to be the medium to make it happen. This historic achievement, along with the other crossover events, show just how relevant the game is in society, being able to mix itself with other popular media so often and easily. While not everyone plays Fortnite, it has become very difficult for anyone to not know what the game is, not only because of its references in other media, but also because of its references in the real world.
