                Fortnite is a third-person shooter developed by the studio Epic Games, but more importantly, it is a battle royale. Battle royale games involve several players, either by themselves or in teams, spawning in a chosen location on the map and finding weapons and equipment to fight other players with. As each match progresses, the playable area of the map becomes smaller, forcing the remaining players to interact with each other. In Fortnite, a maximum of one hundred players are spawned into each session, and the last player or team alive wins the match. Much of the equipment that players find in-game are firearms, bullets, and explosive devices inspired by those found in the real world; however, the graphics of Fortnite are very cartoonish and non-threatening, allowing the game to appear far less violent than expected. The landscapes and skyline of the map are filled with bright, vivid colors, and there is no bloodshed of any kind upon shooting another player; the word “kill” is never used in the game either, as the term “elimination” is used for whenever a player loses all of their health. Additionally, the characters players control often have goofy looks or costumes, and those who do not still look impressive without appearing frightening. Fortnite’s stylized design allows for the game to appeal not only to veteran video games players, but also younger audiences who only recently have gotten the chance to start playing video games. A large portion of the Fortnite playerbase consists of pre-teens, teenagers, and young adults, and this popularity among the demographic has helped the game become so widespread. As of March 2019, 53% of Fortnite’s 250 million players were registered as between the ages of ten and twenty-five (Iqbal), but this extreme playerbase was not caused solely by the game’s cartoonish graphics. Fortnite is one of, if not the, most easily accessible video game ever created.
