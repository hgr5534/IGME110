            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                Whether it has been through handwritten letters, handmade table games, mass-produced newspapers, or nation-wide broadcast radio and television, there has always been some form of media used to spread information and entertainment. The most recent type  media to surface is electronic video games, coming to fruition in the late 1950’s in the United States. Since their conception, video games have continuously made as large of a cultural impact as movies and TV shows, but no game has made an impact like 2017’s Fortnite Battle Royale. Normally referred to as just Fortnite, this game has single-handedly managed to incorporate itself into nearly every aspect of today’s popular culture. There are other similar, notable battle royale games such as H1Z1, Player Unknown’s Battlegrounds, and Apex Legends, but Fortnite has three key factors that have allowed it to become such a massive cultural phenomenon: its wide appeal and accessibility to players, its interaction with other media, and its ability to let players perform iconic dance moves in-game.
