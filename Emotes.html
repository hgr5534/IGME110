            <h2>Popular Emotes and High Appeal</h2>
            <p>
                Perhaps the greatest way people become aware of Fortnite, for children and adults alike, is the iconic dances players can perform within the game. At the time of writing, there are just over 230 different “emotes” that players have access to, many of which are based on popular, real-life dances (Fortnite Tracker Network)--this is by far the largest instance of Fortnite excelling in directly tying itself to real world culture. Incorporating these dances drastically increases awareness of the game, as it is not uncommon to see fans of it--especially kids--doing them in public. The iconic dance moves of Fortnite are known all over the world, to the extent where both adult and child athletes from several different countries have performed them during major televised sporting events (Dator). Several talk show hosts have covered the game and performed its dances as well, which further boosts the awareness of the game; the most notable examples are Jimmy Fallon (Ashcraft) and Ellen DeGeneres (Lainer). Even cartoon television channels have had their characters perform the game’s dances, specifically when Cartoon Network released a video on YouTube showcasing this (Cartoon Network). Fortnite’s popularity skyrocketed with the publicity it has obtained through these mediums, and it only continues to grow because of them.
